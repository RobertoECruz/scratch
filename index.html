<p>Hello World</p>
<p>I pulled changes made from the git GUI (git pull the index file and the new branch)</p>
<p>I then switched from master branch to gh-pages branch (git checkout gh-pages)</p>
<p>Thus, this leads me to this index.html file that was originally just Hello World and now includes documentation.</p>
<p>Let development on the first project site begin!</p>
