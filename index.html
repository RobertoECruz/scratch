Hello World
I pulled changes made from the git GUI (git pull the index file and the new branch)
I then switched from master branch to gh-pages branch (git checkout gh-pages)
Thus, this leads me to this index.html file that was originally just Hello World and now includes documentation.
Let development on the first project site begin!
